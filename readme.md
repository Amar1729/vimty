# Vimty: A vim typewriter

[Here's a video of it in action](https://youtu.be/8ChbGvh-Cec)

## Dependencies

### For MacOS
* chunkwm
* a script or plugin to manage floating windows in chunkwm

* vim >7.4 (for some of the buffer stuff)
* normal shell stuff like awk, head, cut

## How to use
1. In vim: `:source vimty.vim`
2. If you didn't get a ton of errors, it's probably working

Side note: It might be difficult to use this if your vim window is > half of your screen width or height, depending on how i3 is feeling. It might not want to position off the top or left of the screen!
